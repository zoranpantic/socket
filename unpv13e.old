unpv13e would not link sctp and unp.h was having squibble line in and some strange problem wiht sctp.h not being found. 
I checked and my ssytem had sctp.h

Don't know if this made any difference, but I did it first. Next time start from second step and see if it solves the problem

Here is what I did as described on that web page
Basic environment:

Operating system Debian
GCC development environment, MAKE, first of all to have the C compiler, make based tools. If not, can be installed through the following command. This command will install a set of tools, which contains the required a lot of Linux C development tool. 
sudo apt-get install build-essential

(1)Download unpv.13e.tar.gz from the internet. In the online search a lot. Unpv.12e.tar.gz version of the problem, so to avoid the use of. Download the installation package after decompression can follow his instructions to install README file. Decompression of the command is

tar -xvf unpv.13e.tar.gz

(2)Now you can CD to unpv13e directory. The following two commands can generate the corresponding library function in the unpv13e directory.
cd unpv13e
./configure
cd lib && make

(3)Return to your unpv13e directory, will generate the libunp.a to copy the database file directory. The corresponding shell command.
cd ..
sudo cp libunp.a /usr/lib  
sudo cp libunp.a /usr/lib64

(4)Modify the unp.h and the config.h copy to /usr/iinclude
gedit lib/unp.h   //The unp.h #include "../config.h" modify#include "config.h"

sudo cp lib/unp.h /usr/include  
sudo cp config.h /usr/include 


(5)Write a small program to test it, in the unpv13e intro directory contains several examples. Can be used to test. And see if you can generate the corresponding executable file.


cd ./intro  
gcc daytimetcpcli.c -o daytimetcpcli -lunp 


Following is the change I did in configurations for VisualStudioCode in Linux
I am using gcc
After changing Include path to (this seems to solve it) No more problem with unp.h and no more problem with sctp.h
${workspaceFolder}/
${workspaceFolder}/lib
All worked like charm
