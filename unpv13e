unpv13e would not link sctp and unp.h was having squibble line in and some strange problem wiht sctp.h not being found. 
I checked and my ssytem had sctp.h

Don't know if this made any difference, but I did it first. Next time start from second step and see if it solves the problem

I am using gcc
After changing Include path to (this seems to solve it) No more problem with unp.h and no more problem with sctp.h
${workspaceFolder}/
${workspaceFolder}/lib
